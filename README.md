#### Description:
The goal of this project is to solve a variation of the classic N-Queens problem, called "Queens Battle," where the objective is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. In addition to the standard N-Queens constraints (no two queens in the same row, column, or diagonal), the board is divided into distinct regions of different colors. The placement of queens should respect these colored regions, and additional constraints may apply depending on the color of the area.
